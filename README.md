# City_Women_Hackathon

The goal is to analyze how Manchester City Women build an attack using the ball from different zones on the pitch, specifically divided into four quarters. The analysis involves six steps, starting with exploratory data analysis, followed by data cleaning. The pitch is then divided into four quarters, each with their respective start and end zones. The labels for the quarters are assigned from left to right, with the goalkeeper being in the leftmost quarter labeled 'defensive'. The next three quarters are labeled 'predefensive', 'preoffensive', and 'offensive', respectively. To determine the most impactful passing, a points system is added. Finally, the data is visualized to provide a clearer understanding of the analysis.

From the technical aspects, you will need Python to run this project and the following libraries :
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. json
5. mplsoccer
